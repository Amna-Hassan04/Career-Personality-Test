        <br> <h2>Personality Description</h2><br>
        <p>INFJs are visionaries who have a different view of the world. They love introspection and refuse to take things at a surface level. They could be termed weird by others because of how they see life. The INFJ are idealists who love understanding complex issues. They are reserved leaders who are usually creatives due to how easily they get inspired.
            Also known as the diplomats, the INFJ prefers to cooperate with members of their team as opposed to conflict.
            The dominant cognitive function of an INFJ is introverted intuition which helps them focus on internal insights and generally influences their decision making. Their tertiary cognitive function is an extraverted feeling which makes them highly sensitive to the feeling of others or what others refer to as being empathetic. 
            The INFJ thrives in jobs that require a deal of compassion, psychology and/or collaboration.</p>
