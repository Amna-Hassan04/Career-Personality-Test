   <br> <h2>Myer-Briggs Personality Test</h2><br>
    <p>In the following questions you must make one of two choices: a or b. Set aside some time for yourself
        without interruptions. Perhaps, in some cases, you will feel like choosing both a and b. Even if you
        agree with both answers, check the one with which you agree more.
        To yield an accurate description of yourself, it is imperative that you answer the questionnaire honestly.
        Answer as you really are, not as the person you would like to be.
        As much as possible, try to make choices outside the context of your job. In other words, questionnaire
        results can be altered if you interpret too many questions with your job in mind. The fact that we have
        certain job responsibilities and strong interests should not be used to cloud the results. Therefore, try to
        think of situations in which you are more free to be yourself.
        There are no right or wrong answers. Just be honest with yourself as you read and make choices. 
        16-Personality is a personality framework that can help you understand other people and why they behave in certain ways.
